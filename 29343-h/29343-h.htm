<h2>EDUCATION.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>

<p>Now that I have given away the certificates it will be expected
that I should make a few remarks on that inexhaustible subject,
Education. My remarks will be brief.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity of explaining to our visitors the nature
of the Higher Certificate examination. It is an examination
instituted originally to test the efficiency of the highest forms
of our public schools, and to enable boys to pass the earlier
University examinations while still at school. The subjects of
study are divided into four groups. In order to obtain a
certificate it is necessary to pass in four subjects taken from not
less than three groups. A certificate therefore<span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[Pg 1]</a></span> ensures
a sound and fairly wide education. The subjects of the groups are
languages, mathematics, English history, and lastly science. One
concession is made to girls which is not made to boys. They are
allowed to pass in two subjects one year, and two others the next,
and thus obtain their certificates piecemeal. Boys have to pass in
all four subjects the same year. The High School sent in seventeen
candidates for the examination in two or three of the
subjects&mdash;History, Elementary Mathematics, French, German, and
Latin,&mdash;and fifteen of these passed in two subjects at least:
and, inasmuch as seven of them had in a previous year passed in two
other subjects, they obtained their certificates. The rest carry on
their two subjects, and will, we hope, obtain their certificates
next summer; six of them appear to be still in the school. This is
a very satisfactory result. The value of these certificates to the
public is the testimony they give to the very high efficiency of
the teaching. These examinations are not of the
standard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]
</a></span> of the Junior or Senior Local Examinations. They are
very much harder. And all who know about these matters see at a
glance that a school that ventures to send in its girls for this
examination only is aiming very high. The certificates for Music,
given by the Harrow Music School examiners, are also recognised by
the profession as having a considerable value. But on this subject
I cannot speak with the same knowledge.</p>

<p>The value of these examinations to the mistresses is that they
serve as a guide and standard for teaching. We are all of us the
better for being thus kept up to the mark. Their value to you is
that they help to make your work definite and sound: and that, if
it is slipshod, you shall at any rate know that it is slipshod.</p>

<p>Therefore, speaking for the Council, and as the parent of a High
School girl, and as one of the public, I may say that we set a very
high value on these examinations and their results. They test and
prove absolute merit. Now, you may have<span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> noticed
that one of the characteristics of this school is the absence of
all prizes and personal competitions within the school itself; all
that only brings out the relative merit of individuals. I dare say
you have wondered why this should be so, and perhaps grumbled a
little. "Other girls," you say, "bring home prizes: our brothers
bring home prizes; or at any rate have the chance of doing
so&mdash;why don't we?" And not only you, but some friends of the
school who would like to give prizes&mdash;for it is a great
pleasure to give prizes&mdash;have sometimes wondered why Miss
Woods says "No." I will tell you why. Miss Woods holds&mdash;and I
believe she is quite right&mdash;that to introduce the element of
competition, while it would certainly stimulate the clever and
industrious to more work, would also certainly tend to obscure and
weaken the real motives for work in all, which ought to outlive,
but do not always outlive, the age at which prizes are won.</p>

<p>Intelligent industry, without the induce<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>ment of
prizes, is a far more precious and far more durable habit than
industry stimulated by incessant competition. Teaching and learning
are alike the better for the absence of this element, when
possible. I consider this to be one of the most striking
characteristics of our High School, and one of which you ought to
be most proud. It is a distinction of this school. And when you
speak of it, as you well may do, with some pride, you will not
forget that it is due entirely to the genius and character of your
Head-mistress. I believe that one result will be, that you will be
the more certain to continue to educate yourselves, and not to
imagine that education is over when you leave school.</p>

<p>Is it necessary to say anything to you about the value of
education? I think it is; because so many of the processes of
education seem at the time to be drudgery, that any glimpses and
reminders of the noble results attained by all this drudgery are
cheering and encouraging. The reason why it is worth your while to
get the best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id=
"Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> possible education you can, to
continue it as long as you can, to make the very most of it by
using all your intelligence and industry and vivacity, and by
resolving to enjoy every detail of it, and indeed of all your
school life, is that it will make you&mdash;<i>you
yourself</i>&mdash;so much more of a person. More&mdash;as being
more pleasant to others, more useful to others, in an ever-widening
sphere of influence, but also more as attaining a higher
development of your own nature.</p>

<p>Let us look at two or three ways in which, as you may easily
see, education helps to do some of these things.</p>

<p>Education increases your interest in everything; in art, in
history, in politics, in literature, in novels, in scenery, in
character, in travel, in your relation to friends, to servants, to
everybody. And it is <i>interest</i> in these things that is the
never-failing charm in a companion. Who could bear to live with a
thoroughly uneducated woman?&mdash;a country milkmaid, for
instance, or an uneducated milliner's girl. She<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> would
bore one to death in a week. Now, just so far as girls of your
class approach to the type of the milkmaid or the milliner, so far
they are sure to be eventually mere gossips and bores to friends,
family, and acquaintance, in spite of amiabilities of all sorts.
Many-sided and ever-growing interests, a life and aims capable of
expansion&mdash;the fruits of a trained and active mind&mdash;are
the durable charms and wholesome influences in all society. These
are among the results of a really liberal education. Education does
something to overcome the prejudices of mere ignorance. Of all
sorts of massive, impenetrable obstacles, the most hopeless and
immovable is the prejudice of a thoroughly ignorant and
narrow-minded woman of a certain social position. It forms a solid
wall which bars all progress. Argument, authority, proof,
experience avail nought. And remember, that the prejudices of
ignorance are responsible for far more evils in this world than
ill-nature or even vice. Ill-nature and vice are not
very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg
7]</a></span> common, at any rate in the rank of ladies; they are
discountenanced by society; but the prejudices of ignorance&mdash;I
am sure you wish me to tell you the truth&mdash;these are not
rare.</p>

<p>Think, moreover, for a moment how much the cultivated
intelligence of a few does to render the society in which we move
more enjoyable: how it converts "the random and officious
sociabilities of society" into a quickening and enjoyable
intercourse and stimulus: everybody can recall instances of such a
happy result of education. This can only be done by educated women.
How much more might be done if there were more of them!</p>

<p>And think, too, how enormously a great increase of trained
intelligence in our own class&mdash;among such as you will be in a
few years&mdash;would increase the power of dealing with great
social questions. All sorts of work is brought to a standstill for
want of trained intelligence. It is not good will, it is not
enthusiasm, it is not money that is wanted for all sorts of work;
it is good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg
8]</a></span> sense, trained intelligence, cultivated minds. Some
rather difficult piece of work has to be done; and one runs over in
one's mind who could be found to do it. One after another is given
up. One lacks the ability&mdash;another the
steadiness&mdash;another the training&mdash;another the mind
awakened to see the need: and so the work is not done. "The harvest
truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few." A really liberal
education, and the influence at school of cultivated and vigorous
minds, is the cure for this.</p>

<p>Again, you will do little good in the world unless you have wide
and strong sympathies: wide&mdash;so as to embrace many different
types of character; strong&mdash;so as to outlast minor rebuffs and
failures. Now understanding is the first step to sympathy, and
therefore education widens and strengthens our sympathies: it
delivers us from ignorant prepossessions, and in this way alone it
doubles our powers, and fits us for far greater varieties of life,
and for the unknown demands that the future may make upon
us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg
9]</a></span></p>

<p>I spoke of the narrowness and immovability of ignorance. There
is another narrowness which is not due to ignorance so much as to
persistent exclusiveness in the range of ideas admitted. Fight
against this with all your might. The tendency of all uneducated
people is to view each thing as it is by itself, each part without
reference to the whole; and then increased knowledge of that part
does little more than intensify the narrowness.
Education&mdash;liberal education&mdash;and the association with
many and active types of mind, among people of your own age, as
well as your teachers, is the only cure for this. Try to understand
other people's point of view. Don't think that you and a select few
have a monopoly of all truth and wisdom. "It takes all sorts to
make a world," and you must understand "all sorts" if you would
understand the world and help it.</p>

<p>You are living in a great age, when changes of many kinds are in
progress in our political and social and religious ideas. There
never was a greater need of trained<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 10]</a></span> intelligence, clear
heads, and earnest hearts. And the part that women play is not a
subordinate one. They act directly, and still more indirectly. The
best men that have ever lived have traced their high ideals to the
influence of noble women as mothers or sisters or wives. No man who
is engaged in the serious work of the world, in the effort to
purify public opinion and direct it aright, but is helped or
hindered by the women of his household. Few men can stand the
depressing and degrading influence of the uninterested and placid
amiability of women incapable of the true public spirit, incapable
of a generous or noble aim&mdash;whose whole sphere of ideas is
petty and personal. It is not only that such women do nothing
themselves&mdash;they slowly asphyxiate their friends, their
brothers, or their husbands. These are the unawakened women; and
education may deliver you from this dreadful fate, which is
commoner than you think.</p>

<p>In no respect is the influence of women more important than in
religion. Much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id=
"Page_24">[Pg 11]</a></span> might be said of the obstacles placed
in the way of religious progress by the crude and dogmatic
prepossessions of ignorant women, who will rush in with confident
assertion where angels might fear to tread: but this is neither the
time nor the place for such remarks. It is enough to remind you
that in no part of your life do you more need the width and modesty
and courage of thought, and the delicacy of insight given by
culture, than when you are facing the grave religious questions of
the day, either for yourself or others.</p>

<p>But let me turn to a somewhat less serious subject. We earnestly
desire that women should be highly educated. And yet is there not a
type of educated woman which we do not wholly admire? I am not
going to caricature a bluestocking, but to point out one or two
real dangers. Education is good; but perfect sanity is better
still. Sanity is the most excellent of all women's excellences. We
forgive eccentricity and one-sidedness&mdash;the want of perfect
sanity&mdash;in men, and especially<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 12]</a></span> men of genius; and we
rather reluctantly forgive it in women of genius; but in ordinary
folk, no. These are the strong-minded women; ordinary folk, who
make a vigorous protest against one or two of the minor mistakes of
society, instead of lifting the whole: I should call these, women
of imperfect sanity. It is a small matter that you should protest
against some small maladjustment or folly; but it is a great matter
that you should be perfectly sane and well-balanced. Now education
helps sanity. It shows the proportion of things. An American
essayist bids us "keep our eyes on the fixed stars." Education
helps us to do this. It helps us to live the life we have to lead
on a higher mental and spiritual level it glorifies the actual.</p>

<p>And now, seeing these things are so, what ought to be the
attitude of educated girls and women towards pleasures, the usual
pleasures of society? Certainly not the cynical one&mdash;"Life
would be tolerable if it were not for its pleasures."
Pleasures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg
13]</a></span> do make up, and ought to make up, a considerable
portion of life. Now I have no time for an essay on pleasures. I
will only offer two remarks. One is that the pleasure open to all
cultivated women, even in the pleasures that please them least, is
the pleasure of giving pleasure. Go to give pleasure, not to get
it, and that converts anything into a pleasure. The other remark
is, Pitch your ordinary level of life on so quiet a note that
simple things shall not fail to please. If home, and children, and
games, and the daily routine of life&mdash;if the sight of October
woods and the Severn sea, and of human happy faces fail to please,
then either in fact or in imagination you are drugging yourself
with some strong drink of excitement, and spoiling the natural
healthy appetite for simple pleasures. This is one of the dangers
of educated women: but it is their danger because they are
imperfectly educated: educated on one side, that of books; and not
on the other and greater side, of wide human sympathies.
Society<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg
14]</a></span> seems to burden and narrow and dull the uneducated
woman, but it also hardens and dulls a certain sort of educated
woman too, one who refuses her sympathies to the pleasures of life.
But to the fuller nature, society brings width and fresh clearness.
It gives the larger heart and the readier sympathy, and the wider
the sphere the more does such a nature expand to fill it.</p>

<p>What I am now saying amounts to this, that an educated
intelligence is good, but an educated sympathy is better. I recall
certain lines written by the late Lord Carlisle on being told that
a lady was plain and commonplace:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i4">"You say that my love is
plain,<br /></span> <span class="i6">But that I can never
allow,<br /></span> <span class="i4">When I look at the thought for
others<br /></span> <span class="i6">That is written on her
brow.<br /></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i4">"The eyes are not fine, I
own,<br /></span> <span class="i6">She has not a well-cut
nose,<br /></span> <span class="i4">But a smile for others'
pleasure<br /></span> <span class="i6">And a sigh for others'
woes.<br /></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i4">"Quick to perceive a
want,<br /></span> <span class="i6">Quicker to set it
right,<br /></span> <span class="i4">Quickest in
overlooking<br /></span> <span class="i6">Injury, wrong, or
slight.<br /></span> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id=
"Page_28">[Pg 15]</a></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i4">"Hark to her words to the
sick,<br /></span> <span class="i6">Look at her patient
ways,<br /></span> <span class="i4">Every word she
utters<br /></span> <span class="i6">Speaks to the speaker's
praise.<br /></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i4">"Purity, truth, and
love,<br /></span> <span class="i6">Are they such common
things?<br /></span> <span class="i4">If hers were a common
nature<br /></span> <span class="i6">Women would all have
wings.<br /></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i4">"Talent she may not
have,<br /></span> <span class="i6">Beauty, nor wit, nor
grace,<br /></span> <span class="i4">But until she's among the
angels<br /></span> <span class="i6">She cannot be
commonplace."<br /></span></div>
</div>

<p>There is something to remember: cultivate sympathy, gentleness,
forgiveness, purity, truth, love: and then, though you may have no
other gifts, "until you're among the angels, you cannot be
commonplace."</p>

<p>And here I might conclude. But I should not satisfy myself or
you, if I did so without paying my tribute of genuine commendation
to the High School, and of hearty respect for the Head-mistress and
her staff of teachers. Clifton owes Miss Woods a great debt for the
tone of high-mindedness and loyalty, for the moral and<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 16]</a></span>
intellectual stamp that she has set on the School. She has won, as
we all know, the sincere respect and attachment of her mistresses
and her old pupils; and the older and wiser you grow the more you
all will learn to honour and love her. And you will please her best
by thorough loyalty to the highest aims of the School which she
puts before you by her words and by her example.</p>

<p>It is a real pleasure to find myself in Bath on an educational
mission. I have ancestral and personal educational connections with
Bath of very old standing. My father was curate of St. Michael's
before I was born; my grandfather and uncle were in succession
head-masters of the Grammar School here, fine scholars both, of the
old school. My first visit to Bath was when I was nine years old,
and on that occasion I had my first real stand-up fight with a
small Bath Grammar School boy. I think that if the old house is
still standing I could find the place where we fought, and where a
master<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg
17]</a></span> brutally interrupted us with a walking-stick. Since
those days, my relations with Bath have been rare, but peaceful;
unless, indeed, the honourable competition between Clifton College
and its brilliant daughter, Bath College, may be regarded as a
ceaseless but a friendly combat between their two head-masters whom
you see so peaceably side by side.</p>

<p>I propose, first, to say a few words about the condition of
schools twenty years ago, before the present impulse towards the
higher education of women gave us High Schools and Colleges at the
Universities, and other educational movements. There is a most
interesting chapter in the report of the Endowed Schools Commission
of 1868 on girls' schools, and some valuable evidence collected by
the Assistant Commissioners. It is not ancient history yet, and
therein lies its great value to us. It shows us the evils from
which we are only now escaping in our High Schools: evils which
still prevail to a formidable extent in a large section of girls'
education, and from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id=
"Page_35">[Pg 18]</a></span> which I can scarcely imagine Bath is
wholly free.</p>

<p>The report speaks of the general indifference of parents to the
education of their girls in our whole upper and middle class, both
absolutely and relatively to that of their boys. That indifference
in part remains. There was a strong prejudice that girls could not
learn the same subjects as boys, and that even if they could, such
an education was useless and even injurious. That prejudice still
survives, in face of facts.</p>

<p>The right education, it was thought, for girls, was one of
accomplishments and of routine work, with conversational knowledge
of French. The ideal of a girl's character was that she was to be
merely amiable, ready to please and be pleased; it was, as was
somewhat severely said by one of the Assistant Commissioners, not
to be good and useful when married, but to <i>get</i> married.
There was no ideal for single women. They did not realize how much
of the work of the world must go undone<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 19]</a></span> unless
there is a large class of highly educated single women. This view
of girls' education is not yet extinct.</p>

<p>Corresponding to the ideal on the part of the ordinary British
parent was, of course, the school itself. There was no high ideal
of physical health, and but little belief that it depended on
physical conditions; therefore the schools were neither large and
airy, nor well provided with recreation ground; not games and play,
but an operation known as "crocodiling" formed the daily and
wearisome exercise of girls. That defect also is common still.
There was no ideal of art, or belief in the effect of artistic
surroundings, and therefore the schools were unpretending even to
ugliness and meanness. The walls were not beautified with pictures,
nor were the rooms furnished with taste. There was no high ideal of
cultivating the intelligence, and therefore most of the lessons
that were not devoted to accomplishments, such as music,
flower-painting, fancy work, hand-screen making, etc., were given
to memory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg
20]</a></span> work, and note-books, in which extracts were made
from standard authors and specimen sums worked with flourishes
wondrous to behold. The serious study of literature and history was
almost unknown. The memory work consisted in many schools in
learning Mangnall's Questions and Brewer's Guide to
Science&mdash;fearful books. The first was miscellaneous: What is
lightning? How is sago made? What were the Sicilian Vespers, the
properties of the atmosphere, the length of the Mississippi, and
the Pelagian heresy? These are, I believe, actual specimens of the
questions; and the answers were committed to memory. About
twenty-five years ago I examined some girls in Brewer's Guide to
Science. The verbal knowledge of some of them was quite wonderful;
their understanding of the subject absolutely <i>nil</i>. They
could rattle off all about positive and negative electricity, and
Leyden jars and batteries; but the words obviously conveyed no
ideas whatever, and they cheerfully talked utter non<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 21]</a></span>sense in
answer to questions not in the book.</p>

<p>Examinations for schools were not yet instituted; the education
was unguided, and therefore largely misguided. Do not let us
imagine for an instant that these evils have been generally cured.
The secondary education of the country is still in a deplorable
condition; and it behoves us to repeat on all occasions that it is
so. The schools I am describing from the report of twenty years ago
exist and abound and flourish still, owing to the widespread
indifference of parents to the education of their girls, to the
qualifications and training of their mistresses, and the efficiency
of the schools. Untested, unguided, they exist and even thrive, and
will do so until a sounder public opinion and the proved
superiority of well-trained mistresses and well-educated girls
gradually exterminates the inefficient schools. But we are, I fear,
a long way still from this desirable consummation.</p>

<p>What were the mistresses? For the<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 22]</a></span> most part worthy, even
excellent ladies, who had no other means of livelihood, and who had
no special education themselves, and no training whatever.
Naturally they taught what they could, and laid stress on what was
called the <i>formation of character</i>, which they usually
regarded as somehow alternative with intellectual attainments and
stimulus, and progress in which could not be submitted to obvious
tests.</p>

<p>I suppose most of us think that there is no more valuable
assistance in the formation of character than any pursuit that
leads the mind away from frivolous pursuits, egotistic or morbid
fancies, and fills it with memories of noble words and lives,
teaches it to love our great poets and writers, and gives it
sympathies with great causes. But this was not the prevailing
opinion twenty years ago. The influence of good people, good homes,
good example&mdash;in a word truly religious influence, as we shall
all admit&mdash;is the strongest element in the formation of
character; but the next strongest is assuredly that
education<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg
23]</a></span> which teaches us to admire "whatsoever things are
true, whatsoever things are lovely, and whatsoever things are of
good report;" and this ought to be, and is, one of the results of
the literary teaching given by well-educated mistresses.</p>

<p>I have been describing the common type of what used to be called
the "seminaries" and "establishments for young ladies" of twenty
years ago. And it may give you the impression that there was no
good education to be got in those days, and that the ladies of my
generation were therefore very ill-educated. Permit me to correct
that impression. There were homes in which the girls learned
something from father or from mother, or, perhaps, something from a
not very talented governess; but in which they educated themselves
with a hunger and thirst after knowledge, and an enjoyment of
literature that is rare in any school. Do not imagine that any
school education under mistresses however skilled, or resulting in
certificates however brilliant, is really as effective in the
forma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg
24]</a></span>tion of strong intellectual tastes and clear judgment
and ability as the self-education which was won by the mothers of
some of you, by the women of my generation and those before. Such
education was rare, but it was possible, and it is possible still.
Under such a system a few are educated and the many fail
altogether. The advantage of our day is that education is offered
to a much larger number. But I cannot call it better than that
which was won by a few in the generation of your mothers. If we
would combine the exceptional merits of the old system with the
high average merits of the new we must jealously preserve the
element of freedom and self-education.</p>

<p>To return to the report. The indifference of parents and the
public, the inadequacy of school buildings and appliances, the low
intellectual ideals of mistresses, were the evils of twenty years
ago, prevailing very widely and lowering school education, and we
must not expect to have got rid of them altogether. An<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 25]</a></span>
educational atmosphere is not changed in twenty years.</p>

<p>But our High Schools are a very real step in advance. The
numbers of your school show that there is a considerable and
increasing fraction of residents in Bath who do care for the
intellectual quality of the education of their girls; and the
report of the examiners is a most satisfactory guarantee that the
instruction given here is thoroughly efficient along the whole
line. Bath must be congratulated on its High School for Girls, as
it must be congratulated on its College for Boys.</p>

<p>But are we therefore to rest and be thankful in the complacent
belief that we have now at length attained perfection, at least in
our High Schools? I am called in to bless High School education,
and I do bless it from my heart. I know something of it. My own
daughter was at such a school; I have been vice-president of a High
School for ten years. I wish there were High Schools in every town
in England. They have done and are doing<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 26]</a></span> much to
lift the standard of girls' education in England. But I will again
remind you that High Schools are educating but a fraction of the
population, and that the faults of twenty years ago still
characterise our girls' education as a whole.</p>

<p>And now, having said this, I shall not be misunderstood if I go
on to speak of some of the deficiencies in our ideals of girls'
education which seem to me to affect High Schools as well as all
other schools. One point, in which the older education with its
manifold defects had a real merit, is that there was no
over-teaching, no hurry to produce results, and therefore no
disgust aroused with learning and literature. At any rate, the
girls, or the best of them, left school or governess "with an
appetite." Now I consider this is a real test of teaching at school
or college, in science or literature: does it leave boys and girls
hungry for more, with such a love for learning that they will go on
studying of themselves? If the teaching of some science is such
that you never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id=
"Page_44">[Pg 27]</a></span> want to go to another science lecture
as long as you live: your lessons on literature such that your
Shakespeare, your Spenser, your Burke, your Browning will never
again descend from your shelves: then, whatever else schools may
have done, they have sacrificed the future to the present. It is on
this account that the pressure of external examinations and its
effect on the teaching of mistresses must be most carefully
watched. To get immediate results is easy, but it is sometimes at
the cost of later results. Our aim should be not so much to teach,
as to make our pupils love to learn, and have methods of learning;
and every teacher should remember that our pupils can learn far
more than we can teach them; and, as Thring used to say, "hammering
is not teaching." With a system of competitive examinations for the
Army and Civil Service, boys must sometimes sacrifice the future to
the present. Girls need never do so, and therefore girls' schools
need not copy the faults as well as the excellences of boys'
schools.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg
28]</a></span></p>

<p>I have ventured to say so much for an intellectual danger in
High Schools. I do not doubt that your head-mistress is aware of
it, and on her guard: I speak much more to the public, to the
parents, and to the Council (if I may say so), as an expert,
because I know that the public sometimes want to be satisfied that
the education is good at every stage, and they ought to be content
if it is good at the final stage. Another point on which I would
venture to say a word to parents is this. Do not take your girls
away from school too early. Every schoolmaster knows that the most
valuable years, those which leave the deepest marks in character
and intellect, are those from sixteen to eighteen. It is equally
true with girls, as schoolmistresses know equally well. It is in
the later years that they get the full benefit of the higher
teaching, and that much of what may have seemed the drudgery of
earlier work reaps its natural and deserved reward. Let your
children come early, so as to be taught well from the beginning,
and let them stay late.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id=
"Page_46">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not myself know what your buildings may be; but a friend to
whom I wrote speaks of them as inadequate and somewhat unworthy of
the city. May I venture to say to a Bath public that it is worth
while to have first-rate buildings for educational purposes? No
money is better spent. If the Bath public will take this up in
earnest it cannot be doubted that the Girls' School Company would
second their efforts in such an important centre. Come over and see
our Clifton High School, with its spacious lawns and playgrounds
and pleasant rooms, and you will be discontented with a righteous
discontent.</p>

<p>And now I will point out another defect in High School education
which parents and mistresses may do much to remedy. There is
usually&mdash;and I am assuming without direct knowledge that it is
the case here&mdash;no system by which any one girl is known
through her whole school career to any one mistress; nothing
corresponding to the tutor system of our public schools. It follows
that a girl passes from form to<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 30]</a></span> form, and the relation
between her and her mistress is so constantly broken that it is
morally less powerful than it might be. The friendly and permanent
relation of old days is converted into an official and temporary
relation. It will be obvious to any one who reflects that the loss
is great. The cure for it is twofold. The parents may do much by
establishing a friendly relation with the form mistresses of their
girls. I have known parents who had never taken the trouble to
inquire even the names of their girls' mistress. If parents wish to
get really the best out of a school, I would say to them (and I am
speaking specially to mothers), you are delegating to the form
mistress a very large share of the responsibility for the formation
of your daughter's character; the least you can do is to be in the
most friendly and confidential communication with her that
circumstances permit. And I would say to the mistresses that, as
far as is possible, you should be to the girls what form masters
are in a good school to their boys&mdash;friends in school
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg
31]</a></span> out of school, acquainted with their tastes,
companions sometimes in their games or their walks, and in all ways
breaking down the merely formal relation of teacher and pupil. The
ideally bad master, as I have often said to my young masters on a
first appointment, is one who as soon as his boys clear out of the
class-room, puts his hands in his pockets and whistles, and thanks
Heaven that he will see no more of the boys for so many hours. I do
not know what the corresponding action on the part of a mistress
may be, as I believe they have no pockets and can't whistle, but
there is probably a corresponding state of mind. I venture,
therefore, to suggest that in our High Schools there should be a
greater <i>rapprochement</i> than is usual between parents and
mistresses and girls in order to make the system more truly
educational in the best sense.</p>

<p>I am now going to turn to a wholly different subject; and I am
going to talk to the girls. In the crusade against the lower type
of education that prevailed twenty<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 32]</a></span> years ago, and still
exists, who are the most important agents? It is the girls who are
still in the High Schools, or who are passing out of them, or who
are otherwise getting the higher education in a few private
schools. "Ye are our epistle, known and read of all men," and read
of all women too, with their still keener eyes.</p>

<p>There is a very real danger in our High Schools that the
intellectual side of education may be overestimated and
overpressed, not by mistresses, but by yourselves; and that the
natural, human, domestic, and family elements in it may be
undervalued. What are you yourselves at home, in society, with
parents, brothers, sisters, children, friends, schoolfellows,
servants? Is the better education, that you are undoubtedly
getting, widening your sympathies, opening your heart and mind to
all the educational influences which do not consist in books or in
work? Is it giving you greater delicacy of touch? Is it opening new
channels for influences, streaming in on you or streaming out from
you?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg
33]</a></span> Your daily life may become a higher education, and
is so to the truly noble-minded and well-educated girl or woman. Do
not regard as interruptions, and as teasing, the calls of
household, the duties to parents, visitors, children, and the rest;
it is part of the education of life to fulfil all these duties
well, delightfully, brilliantly, joyously, enthusiastically; these
things are not interruptions to life, they are life itself. There
was a pitiful magazine article written the other day by some lady
complaining that social duties, the having to see her friends, her
cook, her gardener, her dress-maker, etc., prevented her from
reading Herbert Spencer, and developing her small fragment of soul.
Social duties, rightly done, are one of the developments of soul.
Let it be seen that you girls who can enjoy your literature, and
your history, and your music, and your drawing with keen
appreciation are not made thereby selfish or unsociable; but that
you are more delightful creatures than those who have no such
independent resources and joys. A girl<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 34]</a></span> who
gets her certificate or prize and is cross or dull at home, and
does not think it worth while to be kind and agreeable to a young
brother or an old nurse, to every creature in her household down to
the cat and the canary, is a traitor to the cause of higher
education.</p>

<p>Again, it has been observed that the practical and artistic
elements in school education have been, in general, more thoroughly
developed of late years since they were put into a secondary place.
This is as it should be. Such subjects as music, drawing, cooking,
housekeeping, wood-carving, nursing, needlework, when they are
studied at all, are studied more professionally and thoroughly and
intelligently, and less in the spirit of the amateur and dabbler.
So I would say to you, both now and when you leave, show that your
education in intelligence has given you wide interests and powers
to master all such subjects. Take them up all the more
thoroughly.</p>

<p>Closely akin to this merit of thorough<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 35]</a></span>ness is
the large spirit of unselfishness that ought to come, and certainly
in many instances does come, with wider interests, a more
intelligent education, and a more active imagination. Women in our
class have more leisure than men; they can actually do what is
impossible by the conditions of life for us men to do, link class
to class by knowledge and sympathy and help and kindness. They can
be of immense service in this way. There is a story in the life of
an American lady, Mrs. Lynam, that occurs to me. There was much
conversation about a certain Mr. Robbins, who had lately died; he
had been such a benefactor, such a good man, and so on. A visitor
asked, "Did Mr. Robbins found a benevolent institution?" "No," was
the reply, "he <i>was</i> a benevolent institution." Women of our
class may be, they ought to be, "benevolent institutions." And such
women exist among us; pity is there are so few of them. They can
unobtrusively be centres of happiness, and knowledge, and generous
attitudes of mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id=
"Page_53">[Pg 36]</a></span> Now there ought to be more of such
women, and I look to our High Schools with hope. They ought to make
girls public-spirited and large-minded.</p>

<p>There is another element in girls' education which is only
imperfectly as yet brought out, and which you yourselves can do
something to develop. I mean the better appreciation of an
education which is not in books, and not in accomplishments, and
not in duties, and not in social intercourse. How shall I describe
it? Think of the old Greek education of men. There was a large
element of literature and poetry and natural religion and
imagination in it; and a large element of gymnastic also; but
besides all this it was an education of eye and ear; it was a
training that sprang from reverence for nature, as a whole, for an
ideal of complete life, in body and mind and soul; and not only for
complete individual life, but also for the city, the nation. It was
a consummate perfection of life that was ever leading the Athenian
upward, by a life-long education, to strive<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 37]</a></span> for a
certain grace and finish in every one of his faculties. And we see
to what splendid results in literature and art and civic and
personal beauty it led them.</p>

<p>This element is still wanting in our higher education; it is the
ideal of nobility of life and perfection. We lack it in our
physical education. That is still far from perfect. If we all,
parents, children, boys and girls, schoolmasters and
schoolmistresses, had some of the Greek feeling of high admiration
of physical perfection of form and grace and activity, we should
not see so many boys and girls of very imperfect gracefulness, nor
should we see fashions of dress so ruinous to all ideals of
perfection and grace. We cannot make up for the want of this
national artistic ideal of beauty of figure by artificial
gymnastics, scientific posturings, and ladders and bars. They are
better than nothing, they are a protest, they certainly remedy some
defects and prevent others. But do not you be content with them. By
self-respect and self-discipline, by healthy life, early hours,
open air,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg
38]</a></span> natural exercise, the joyous and free use of all
your powers, by dancing, playing games, by refusal to give way to
unhealthy and disfiguring fashions, and, above all, by an
aspiration after grace and perfection, do what you can to remedy
this national defect in our ideals for girls.</p>

<p>Did you ever read Kingsley's "Nausicaa in London"? Do you all
know who Nausicaa was? If not, let me advise you to borrow
Worsley's "Odyssey" and read Book VI., and read Kingsley's Essay
too. Nausicaa was a Greek maiden who played at ball; and I think
you are doing more to approach the old Greek ideal when you play at
lawn tennis and cricket and hockey, and I would add rounders and
many another game, than when you are going through ordered
exercises, valuable as they are, or even than when you are learning
Greek or copying Greek statues.</p>

<p>This leads me to say that games contribute much to remedy
another deficiency in our ideal. There is a defective power of real
enjoyment of life, of healthy spirits<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 39]</a></span> among us moderns. There
is more enjoyment now than there was. I think my generation was
better than the one that preceded us in this respect; we had more
games, more fun, more <i>abandon</i> in enjoyment than our fathers
and mothers, your grandfathers and grandmothers, had, if we may
judge from letters published and unpublished. And they too often
thought we were a frivolous generation, not so staid and decorous
as we might be, and repressed and checked us; while we on the
contrary urge on you to enjoy more fully the splendour of your
youth and vitality. We desire to see you dance and sing and laugh
and bubble over with the delicious inexhaustible flow of vital
energy; we know that it need not interfere with the refinement of
perfect manners and decorum, and we know too that there is the
force which will sober down and do good work, and there is the
health-giving exercise, the geniality, and the joy that will make
you stronger and pleasanter, more patient and more persuasive to
good in years to come. So it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57"
id="Page_57">[Pg 40]</a></span> is with boys: men are made in our
playgrounds as much as in the class-room; so, too, is it with you.
I must give you a quotation from "Fo'c's'le Yarns," that

<p>There is a word in German which has no<span class=

equivalent; it expresses just the missing ideal I am speaking of.
It is a terrible mouthful, as German words often

<p>We had a visit the other day from an American gentleman, Mr.
Muybridge, who came to give a lecture at Clifton College. I believe
he also lectured in Bath. He remarked to Mrs. Wilson in the
lecture-room that he was glad to see some ladies present. "I like
ladies at my lectures; they are so intelligent." "Yes," she
replied,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg
42]</a></span> "but I fear you are attributing to us the qualities
of American ladies; we are not particularly intelligent." "You are
joking!" was his reply. "No," she went on, "we are always told how
much more intelligent American ladies are than English." He paused
for some time, and then slowly said, "Well, I'll not deny they are
smarter."</p>

<p>Well, this quality that Mr. Muybridge describes as "smartness"
is an American equivalent of Lebensgl&uuml;ckseligkeit; it is a
sort of intensity of life, of vivacity, of willingness to take
trouble, to interest and be interested, that is a little lacking in
our English ideal of young ladies: and we must be on our guard lest
any school ideals of study and bookishness should actually increase
this deficiency. Any one, mistress or girl, who makes good
education to be associated with dulness and boredom and insipidity
is again a traitor to the cause of higher education.</p>

<p>I have run to greater length than I intended, and I will
conclude.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg
43]</a></span></p>

<p>It should be the aim of us all, Council, parents, mistresses,
and girls, to show that our ideal of education includes both the
training of the intelligence and reason, and the storing the mind
with treasures of beauty and instruments of power for opening new
avenues into the storehouse of knowledge and delight that the world
contains; and also the development of the practical ability, the
benevolence and sympathy, the vivacity, the enjoyment of life, the
fulness of activity, bodily and mental, that makes the
Lebensgl&uuml;ckseligkeit I spoke of, and the superadding, or
rather diffusing through it all, an unobtrusive but deep Christian
faith and reverence and charity.</p>

<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury lately said in his charge that
"public schools were infinitely more conducive to a strong morality
than any other institution." He was thinking of boys' schools, of
which he speaks with intimate knowledge; but I believe that, where
girls' schools have at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id=
"Page_61">[Pg 44]</a></span> their head one who in the spirit of
Dr. Arnold recognizes the responsibility for giving an
unostentatious, unpartisan-like, but all-pervading and intelligent
religious tone to the life, the aims, and the ideal of the school,
and where the Council and parents value this influence, there the
influence of girls' High Schools may be more conducive to strong
morality and true religion in England than even that of our great
public schools. For the High Schools are training more and more of
the most influential class among the women of England, as the
public schools are training the men, and the influence of women
must of necessity be of the first importance; for it is they who
determine the religious training and the atmosphere of the home,
and thus profoundly affect the national character. Let us all alike
try to keep before ourselves from day to day and from year to year

attained, both by mistresses and girls, as in a High
School.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg

<h2>RELIGION.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></h2>

<p>I am not going to preach you a sermon of quite the usual type,
but intend rather to offer a few detached remarks without
attempting to weave them into any unity of plan, or to connect them
with any particular text from the Bible. Such unity as these
remarks may possess will result not from design but from the nature
of the subject. For I am going to speak about religion.</p>

<p>Now as I write this word I almost fancy I hear the rustle of an
audience composing itself to endure what it foresees must be a dull
and uninteresting address. "Religion! he can't make that
interesting." Now, why is this? What is religion, that in the eyes
of so many clever and intelli<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 46]</a></span>gent and well-educated
young people it should be thought dull?</p>

<p>Of this one point I am quite sure, that it is the fault of our
misunderstanding and misrepresentation, in the past and the
present, that religion seems dull.</p>

<p>Religion is, in its essence, the opening to the young mind of
all the higher regions of thought and aspiration and imagination
and spirituality. When you are quite young you are occupied of
course with the visible things and people round you; each hour
brings its amusements, its occupations and its delights, and
reflection scarcely begins. But soon questions of right and wrong
spring up; a world of ideas and imaginations opens before you; you
are led by your teachers and your books into the presence of great
thoughts, the inspirations that come from beauty in all forms, from
nature, from art, from literature, and especially from poets; you
come under the influence of friends&mdash;fathers, mothers, or
other elders&mdash;who evidently have springs of conduct and
as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg
47]</a></span>pirations you as yet only dimly recognize; and mixed
with all these influences there is that influence on us from
childhood upward of our prayers that we have been taught, our
religious services, our Bibles, and most of all the Sacred Figure,
dimly seen, but never long absent from our thoughts, enveloped in a
sort of sacred and mysterious halo&mdash;the figure of our Lord
Jesus Christ enshrined in our hearts, and that Father in Heaven of
Whom He spoke. All these are among the religious influences; and
what is their aim and object? What is it that we should try and
extract from them for ourselves? How should we use them in our turn
to better those who come after us?</p>

<p>Well, I reply, they should all be regarded as the avenues by
which our human nature as a whole ought to rise, and the only
avenues by which it can rise, to its rightful and splendid heritage
and its true development. We cannot be all that we might be without
straining our efforts in this direction of aspiration<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 48]</a></span> towards
God, towards all that is ideal, spiritual and divine.</p>
<p>We are often inert, effortless, and then the religion I have
spoken of repels us because it demands an effort; we are often
selfish, and it repels us because it calls us out of self; we are
often absorbed in the small and immediate aims for present
enjoyment, interested in our own small circles, and religion
insists that these are not enough. It is for ever calling us, as
all true education calls us, as literature and history call us, to
rise higher, to see more, to widen our sympathies, to enlarge our
hearts, to open the doors of feeling and emotion. Religion
therefore may make great demands on us; it may disturb our repose;
it may shake us, and say, look, look; look up, look round; it may
be importunate, insistent, omnipresent, but it is not dull.</p>

<p>There is a sham semblance of religion which you are right in
regarding as dull, for it is dull. When it is unreal and insincere
it is deadly dull; when phrases<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 49]</a></span> are repeated, parrotwise,
by people who have either never felt or have long lost their power
and inspiration, then too it is deadly dull. When a sharp line,
moreover, is made between all the various influences that elevate
us, and place us in presence of the ideal and spiritual world; when
the common relations of life, when art, poetry, criticism, science;
when educated and refining intercourse and conversation, and all
that occupies us on our intellectual sides is classed as secular,
and the only helps to religion that are recognized are services and
creeds and traditions of our particular church, then such religion
cuts itself off from many of its springs, and from most of its
fairest fields, and <i>is</i> barren, and unprofitable, and
dull.</p>

<p>You are not likely to make this error. You are perhaps more
likely to make the opposite error, by a natural reaction from this.
Because, when all the world of interest and beauty and human life
is opening before you, you cannot believe that religion is confined
to the narrow sphere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id=
"Page_70">[Pg 50]</a></span> of ideas in which it was once thought
to consist, and is still sometimes declared to consist, you may
think that you can dispense with that narrow but central sphere of
ideas; and there you are wrong. I am quite sure that there is no
inspiring and sustaining force, which shall make your lives worthy,
comparable to the faith which Christ taught the world, that we are
verily the children of God, and sharers of His Divine life, heirs
of an eternal life in Christ towards which we may press, and the
appointed path to which lies in the highest duties that our daily
life presents and consecrates. On this inspiring power of faith in
Christ I shall not speak to-day. I mean to speak on one only of the
duties which form the path to the higher life, which you may
overlook, and yet which is inherent in religion.</p>

<p>The duty which I shall speak of is the necessity of entering
into the life and needs and sympathies of others; of living not
with an eye exclusively on yourself, but with the constant thought
for others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg
51]</a></span> It is the law of our being that admits of no
exception. You may hope that the law of gravitation will be
suspended in your case, and leap out of the window; but you will
suffer for your mistake; and you will be equally mistaken and
equally maim your life, if you think that somehow the law of the
spiritual world would admit of exception, and that you can win
happiness, goodness, and the full tide of life; become the best
that you are capable of being, while remaining isolated,
self-absorbed&mdash;by being centripetal, not centrifugal. It
cannot be. Now this is worth saying to you, because you know here
at school what a united social life is. All girls do not know this.
You do. There is distinctly here a school life, a school feeling, a
house feeling. No casual visitor to your playing fields and hall
can mistake this. And you know that this enlarges and draws
something out of your nature that would never have been suspected
had it not been for school life. But when school life ends, what
will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg
52]</a></span>come of this discovery that you have made? Boys, when
they leave school and have developed the passionate feeling of love
for their old school,&mdash;the strong <i>esprit de corps</i>, the
conviction that in brotherhood and union is their strength and
happiness,&mdash;contrive to find fresh united activities, and
transfer to new bodies their public spirit and power of
co-operation. Their college, their regiment, their football club,
their work with young employ&eacute;s, their parish, their
town&mdash;something is found into which they can throw themselves.
And again and again I have watched how this has become a religion,
a binding and elevating and educating power in the mind of young
men; and again and again, too, I have noticed how without it men
lose interest, lose growth and greatness; individualism creeps on
them, half their nature is stunted. For the individual life is only
half the life; and even that cannot be the rich and full and
glorious thing it might be, unless it is enlarged on all sides, and
rests on a wide social sympathy and love.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>But how is it for girls when they leave school? It is distinctly
harder for you to find lines of united action. Society tends to
individualize young ladies; its ideal for them is elegant inaction
and graceful waiting, to an extent infinitely beyond what it is for
young men. You do not find at your homes ready-made associations to
join, or even an obvious possibility of doing anything for anybody.
And so I have witnessed generous and fine school-girl natures
dwarfed, cabined, confined; cheated of the activities which they
had learned to desire to exercise, becoming individualistic, and
therefore commonplace; not without inward fury and resistance,
secret remonstrance, but concealing it all under the impassive
manner which society demands.</p>

<p>Something is wrong: and your generation is finding this out, and
finding out also its cure. Year by year greater liberty of action
is open to educated women; and educated women are themselves
seeing, and others are seeing for them, that<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 54]</a></span> they
have a part to play in the world which none others can play; if
they do not play it, then work, indispensable to the good of
society, and therefore to their own good, is undone. I say to
<i>their own good</i>, for we all want happiness: but happiness is
not won by seeking for it. Make up your minds on this point, that
there are certain things only to be got by not aiming directly at
them. Aim, for example, at being influential, and you become a
prig; aim at walking and posing gracefully, and you become an
affected and ludicrous object; aim even at breathing quite
regularly, and you fail.</p>

<p>So if you aim at happiness or self-culture or individualistic
completeness, the world seems to combine to frustrate you. People,
circumstances, opportunities, temper, everything goes wrong; and
you lay the blame on everything except the one thing that is the
cause of it all, the fact that you yourself are aiming at the wrong
thing. But aim at making everything go well where you are; aim at
using this treasure of life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75"
id="Page_75">[Pg 55]</a></span> that God has given you for helping
lame dogs over stiles, for making schools, households, games,
parishes, societies, sick-rooms, girls' clubs, what not?&mdash;run
more smoothly; wake every morning with the thought what can I do
to-day to oil the wheels of my little world; and behold people,
circumstances, opportunities, temper, even health, all get into a
new adjustment, and all combine to fill your life with interests,
warmth, affection, culture, and growth: you will find it true: good
measure, shaken down, heaped together, and running over, shall men
give into your bosoms.</p>

<p>Ah! but <i>what</i> can one do? It is so hard to find out the
right thing. Yes; and no possible general rule can be given. You
must fix the ideal in your mind, and be sure that in some way or
other openings will arise. I will not touch life at school; you
know more about that than I do, and perhaps need not that I should
speak of public spirit, and generous temper, and the united life. I
will only say that a girl who does not throw herself into
school<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg
56]</a></span> life with the generous wish to give pleasure and to
lift the tone around her, does not get more than a fraction of the
good that a school life like this can give, and does not do her
duty. I speak of later years alone. And in the first instance, and
always in the first place, stand the claims of home. I dare say you
remember the young lady who wanted to go and learn nursing in a
hospital, and was asked by the doctor why she desired this. "Father
is paralysed," she said, "and mother is nearly blind, and my
sisters are all married, and it is so dull at home; so I thought I
should like nursing." I don't want you to emulate that young
person. Grudge no love and care at home: no one can give such
happiness to parents, brothers, sisters, as you can, and to make
people happy is in itself a worthy mission; it is the next best
thing to making them good. And remember also, that there are many
years before you: and that though it may seem that years are spent
with nothing effected except that somehow things have
gone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg
57]</a></span> more smoothly, you yourself will have been matured,
deepened, and consolidated by a life of duty, in a way in which no
self-chosen path of life could have trained you. And if, as is
quite possible, some of you are impatient already for the exercise
of your powers in some great work, I will preach patience to you
from another motive. It is this: that you are not yet capable of
doing much that is useful, from want of training and general
ability. I remember Miss Octavia Hill once saying that she could
get any quantity of money, and any quantity of enthusiasm, but that
her difficulty was to get trained intelligence, either in men or
women. So, a few days ago, Miss Clementina Black, who is Hon.
Secretary of the Women's Trade Association, said to a friend of my
own that she had had many voluntary lady helpers of various degrees
of education and culture, and that she had found without exception
that the highly educated students were the most fitted to do the
work well; that they alone were capable of the
patience,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg
58]</a></span> accuracy, and attention to detail which were one
essential quality to the doing of such work, and that they alone
could provide the other essentials, which can only spring from a
cultivated mind&mdash;viz., wideness of view, sense of proportion,
and capacity for general interest in other important
questions&mdash;social, literary, and intellectual. "It is this
cultivation of mind which prevents you from being crushed under the
difficulty and tedium and disappointment which must attend every
effort to teach principles and promote ideal aims among the mass of
ignorant, apathetic, uninterested, and helpless working women, who
must themselves in the last resort be the agents in bringing about
a better condition of industry."</p>

<p>You may rest assured that if you set your mind on a career of
splendid usefulness for your fellows (and I hope every one of you
here aims at this), then you will need all the training that the
highest and most prolonged education can give you. Become the most
perfect creature you have it in your power to become.
If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg
59]</a></span> Oxford or Cambridge are open to you, welcome the
opportunity, and use the extra power they will give you. If not,
then utilise the years that lie before you, in perfecting your
accomplishments, in self-education; in interesting and informing
yourself on social questions, in enlarging your horizon, while you
cheerfully, happily, brilliantly perform <i>all</i> your home
duties.</p>

<p>And during this period of preparation which you all must go
through, remember that there are some things which you can do
better in your inexperience and ignorance than any other people.
How is this? Tell me why it would be more comfort, and do more good
sometimes to a poor sick woman to bring her a few primroses or
daffodils than to give her any substantial relief. The reason is
the same. The very freshness and innocence of young faces, that
sympathise without having the faintest suspicion of the sin and
misery of the world, is more refreshing and helpful than the
stronger sympathy of one who really knows all the evil. You can be
primroses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg
60]</a></span> and daffodils, and give glimpses into a purer world
of love and gentleness and peace.</p>

<p>And if a prolonged training is impossible to you, it is often
possible for you to assist in some humble capacity some lady who is
so engaged in work on a scale which you could not yourself touch.
Be her handmaid and fag and slave, and so gradually train yourself
to become capable of independent action.</p>

<p>But to sum up all I am saying it amounts to this&mdash;Where
there's a will there's a way, and I want you to have the will.</p>

<p>Did you ever think for what reason you should have had such a
splendid time of it in your lives? Not two girls in a thousand are
getting such an education as you are, such varied studies, such
vigorous public school life, such historic associations. And why?
Because you are better than others? I think not. It is that you
play your part in the great social organism our national life;
hundreds are toiling for us, digging, spinning, weaving, mining,
building, navigating, that we may have leisure for the<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 61]</a></span>
thought, the love, the wisdom that shall lighten and direct their
lives. You cannot dissociate yourselves from the labouring masses,
and in particular from the women and girls of England. They are
your sisters; and a blight and a curse rests on you if you ignore
them, and grasp at all the pleasures and sweetness and cultivation
of your life with no thought or toil for them. Their lives are the
foundations on which ours rest. It is horrible in one class to live
without this consciousness of a mutual obligation, and mutual
responsibility. All that we get, we get on trust, as trustee for
them. I remember that Thring says somewhere, that "no beggar who
creeps through the street living on alms and wasting them is baser
than those who idly squander at school and afterwards the gifts
received on trust."</p>

<p>I know that our class education isolates us and separates us
from the uneducated and common people as we call them, makes us
perhaps regard them as uninteresting, even repellent. Part of what
we hope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg
62]</a></span> from the girls who come from great schools like this
is, that they shall have a larger sympathy, a truer heart. Remember
all your life long a saying of Abraham Lincoln's, when he was
President of the United States. Some one remarked in his hearing
that he was quite a common-looking man. "Friend," he replied,
gently, "the Lord loves common-looking people best; that is why He
has made so many of them."</p>

<p>You can all make a <i>few</i> friends out of the lower class;
you cannot do much; but learn to know and love a few, and then you
will do wider good than you suspect.</p>

<p>But you are beginning to ask&mdash;Is all this religion? You
expected something else. Let me remind you of the man who came to
Jesus Christ, and asked Him what he should do to obtain eternal
life. And this question, I may explain, means&mdash;What shall I do
that I may enter on that divine and higher life now while I live;
how can I most fully develop my spiritual nature? And the answer
was&mdash;Love God; and love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83"
id="Page_83">[Pg 63]</a></span> your neighbour as yourself. Go
outside yourself in love to all that is divine and ideal in thought
and duty; go outside yourself in love to your neighbour&mdash;and
your neighbour is every one with whom you have any relation; and
then, and then alone, does your own nature grow to its highest and
best. This is the open secret of true religion.</p>

<p>Eastertide is the teacher of ideals. Its great lesson
is&mdash;"If ye were raised together with Christ, seek the things
that are above." If by calling yourself a Christian you mean that
you aim at the higher, the spiritual, the divine life, then think
of things that are above. [Greek: Ta an&ocirc; phroneite], think
heaven itself. And heaven lies around us in our daily
life&mdash;not in the cloister, in incense-breathing aisle, in
devotions that isolate us, and force a sentiment unreal, morbid,
and even false, but in the generous and breathing activities of our
life. Religion glorifies, because it idealizes, that very life we
are each called on to lead. Look, therefore, round in your various
lives and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg
64]</a></span> homes, and ask yourselves what is the ideal life for
me here, in this position, as school-girl, daughter, sister,
friend, mistress, or in any other capacity. Education ought to
enable you to frame an ideal; it ought to give you imagination, and
sympathy, and intelligence, and resource; and religion ought to
give you the strong motive, the endurance, the width of view, the
nobleness of purpose, to make your life a light and a blessing
wherever you are.</p>
